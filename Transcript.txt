nolan's coming at you um i'm doing um
eggplant parmesan
um a chicken and shrimp parmesan
um
just watch the steps as i go
i'm hoping that everybody says bye as i
go through these steps and you learn as
i go through these steps
and i'm hoping that you will enjoy all
that you see um a little background on
me um
i am a chef from switzerland geneva
where i trained
um worked and been in various different
restaurants hotel along catering speak
nine languages fluently um also write
them
been executive chef in a number of
places
um also done weddings also done by
mitzvahs anniversaries um
a number of different things often do
menu plan also right diets
um
i'm available on any type of culinary
cuisine art that there is
um
if you would like to get in touch with
me in any way possible my email address
is senal71
at yahoo.com um
anyway i could be a beneficiary to you
and anybody else going to do is contact
me you can email me at that address um
everybody i do apply to um as i go on on
this journey me and you
you'll learn come on
um
my first step will be um
will be my chicken and um rigatoni pasta
um
one of the things you have to do is
in cooking is there real techniques
and one of the primary techniques is
um
having your pan hot already the food
already properly prepared
um i've already heated this pan up
so
what that does is
once the pan already goes the food goes
into the pan
it's already hot
but you put the food in the cold pan
you're not getting the right and proper
techniques in the cooking
that does exist
um in my journey of being a chef
um i also teach so i also teach students
of all ages you know the proper
techniques of cooking as we all know
there are techniques should i say if we
all know
um i've prepared a rigatoni pasta
seasoned already with italian seasoning
herbs and spices
um
i'll do is first step i'll do is like i
said i heat my pan
i add my olive oil
so i had the olive oil let that heat
and the process of
me putting it in
what i do is being in the pan is huh
that will
automatically heat up
um everything that go in after that
um so again what it does is
it speeds up the cooking process and it
makes the process a lot
more better
um
a lot of questions you may have
if you just carefully watch
your questions will virtually be
answered
again i prepared the chicken with
various different on fresh ingredients
bell pepper
um yellow bell pepper
onions
garlic
sewn soap off
um
come with me
and you will learn
just put it in so
we'll give that some time to heat up
and once we get
will be that
um
one of the things i want to
let the people see
in this process is
as i spoke already
is the fresh foods always remember
you'll get the best of flavoring when
you use fresh ingredients
um i teach and i've taught not to use
canned or bottled um
ingredients because
the food primarily doesn't come out
great
um
it really doesn't
so
some of you that are
cult so in the process of being shops
going to school
you will learn that
one of the things i'm doing right now is
i'm softening my lemon
um i'll finish that
off in my sauce
that i make
with this
so again pay close attention and paying
close attention you will learn and again
any questions that you have
most likely will be answered if you just
watch and pay close attention
all right um
again like i said you want to do is you
want to get your pan real hot and once
you get your pan real hot
um
the process will be a lot better
all right
let's grab a cup of
garlic
but what you want to do is
you want to be able to cook these
vegetables until they're translucent
once they're translucent a lot of flavor
come up out of them
um
along with the flavor coming up out of
them
it gets the process of cooking
real well
um
you add a little bit of
parsley stuff
to here
which one forward
most people use a masala
which is a good one
for cooking
see
so
i also add
basil
this is an italian ingredient
very perfumey strong
herb which is very nice
that's a wonderful taste to it
it really is
again you always want to use the finest
ingredients
that they're wrong
it makes your food come out very
spectacular
very nice
i'm also going to add some
parmesan cheese
some mozzarella cheese to this
uh
i have a very great aroma right now
i actually already had it
because of the fresh ones and spices
very nice
very tasty
okay we're going to plate this dish
and tighten this dish
alright first let me say this
send it very good
nice taste
very very nice
so
add a little bit more parmesan to it
just coming back at you um i just ate a
dish that i made on
chicken francis um
tantalizing nice
good
what type of rate would you say it was
for me i think it over tops a scale
i
i love the spices
i love the noodles
i'm not a pasta eater at all
so for me
it just all blends together it's it's so
many flavors going on but they all
complement each other
immensely to where
your mouth just waters and you just want
more because this is my second helping
what else do
i don't know what else to say i mean
it's
it's delicious i've
i've never had so many ingredients in my
mouth at one time
but i'm not trying to question what they
are
you can taste them but again they just
complement each other i i don't know
what else to say
but i'm gonna eat
thanks enough well
that was great of you and it was my
divine pleasure to prepare that meal for
you and others
um right now i'm gonna do is uh
eggplant parmesan
and uh
just eggplant parmesan
it's sort of one of a kind
we know it can be done
with a
number of different things
i'm going to add
some extra large shrimp to it
and
give it a very different taste
along with a very nice flavor
um
in doing so
um
just what does it go as i go along
you know again any questions that you
may have rather single minor to yourself
i prepared the tomato sauce
fresh tomatoes
tomato puree
um
fresh herbs
basil
um
oregano
we're gonna make a
chicken parmesan
with uh
extra
um
large shrimp
and um eggplant
so meal like this is very enticing
very succulent
um smooth meal
um
great italian spices and
coordinated well very nice italian dish
um

you can gladly get in touch with me
morning
morning night
isn't a problem whatsoever
um like i said i prepared the sauce
which is a
very nice sauce
um
one of my favorites
i've done i had it cooking for a number
of hours so all the ingredients can seep
in
you can get all the uh
translucentness
from all of the vegetables
um
again um
very great source
um
if you email me
um
you can follow me and i can give you the
recipe to it
that's not a problem
um take this sauce and sit to the side
i'm whatsoever
fry my eggplant parmesan
eggplant
got to get the pan hot that's very
important to get your pan hot first
you never want to put food inside of a
cold pan
it's not the proper technique
it also slows down the process of
cooking as well
so
my pan should be nice and hot
compare my oil
it speeds
up process
of getting hot
um
again
if you feel like you have any questions
most times if you just pay attention
a lot of your questions will be answered
by just watching
the cheese most time
then slices
always remember the thinner the slice
the quicker the better the cheese will
melt evenly
if you cut it too thick
the cheese will take longer
to melt
and that's not really that good
and make sure that it's solid
um you don't want you don't want it to
be soft
when you buy it
make sure it's not bruised or damaged
any type of weight
get
thin slices
you'll have to cook them too long
on each side
this is fettuccine
i'm gonna do the feta cheating with
shrimp
as well
great combination meal
so
i'm doing the jumbo extra large shrimp
with fettuccine
and the marinara sauce
this dish is very great
very very great
this dish there
um
also this is an award-winning dish as
well
um
very scrumptious
this dish is very tasty
as well
you have to be careful with this shrimp
you don't want to overcook it
you can't overcook it
it isn't done right
it can be overcooked
you
